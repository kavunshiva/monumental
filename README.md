# Monumental: A network-synchronized control panel for hardware.

Monumental integrates a web client and hardware-connected server via Flask, Python scripting, and an Arduino sketch. JavaScript elements, e.g. sliders, synchronize to a server, which controls e.g. the color and illumination of an indexable LED strip.
